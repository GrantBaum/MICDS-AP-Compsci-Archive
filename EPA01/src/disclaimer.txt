THIS PROJECT USES CONCEPTS NOT COVERED IN CLASS (UNIT 1-2 SO FAR) DONE WITH INTERNET RESEARCH AS WELL
AS PREVIOUSLY HELD OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE. PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE THINGS
WITHIN WORK.

BigDecimal: Bigdecimal is a library used to round double values to a certain amount of decimal places,
not only to an int. It does this by rounding the value, converting it into a string and printing the created
string.

try / catch: a type of invalid input protection. All of the scanner code will be within a try catch block, where the user
is involved. If the user inputs some sort of data we cant accept THAT WILL THROW AN EXCEPTION (like typing a string)
the computer can catch it instead of crashing.

while loop: an important part of the try catch loop is the while loop. The program could just end with an error
if an exception is caught, but usually it is better to re prompt the user to try again. We could put every single
input into its own try catch loop and only re prompt for the single thing they missed, but this is an extra
ungraded assignment so well just prompt the user for all three since its their fault for being stupid anyways.

sleeping: pauses the program. For a CLI like this one, it is purely for aesthetics. Note that you have to handle
the interupted exception, which is where the program wakes up early, but usually you dont have to do anything
cause its not that big of a deal if the program goes too fast.
