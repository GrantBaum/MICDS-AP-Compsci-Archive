PA02: Bug Hunt!
Description/Instructions:
Mr. Rosen started writing a program that calculates the floor area of his house, which is composed of:
A rectangle (16 ft x 7 ft)
A circular tower (radius 18 ft)
A triangular section (base 12 ft, height 7 ft)

Here's what he's got so far.

Create a PA02 project in Eclipse and copy the .java file from the link above into it. Note that it does not successfully compile or run. You will fix the code by directly editing the file.
Your task for this programming assignment is to do the following:
Fill out the header with your information
Fix any compile-time errors
Fix any exceptions
Fix any logic errors
Get the program to print the total area
There may be multiple ways to fix these bugs, but regardless of how you go about it, your final program should produce the output below. 


Output:
Mr. Rosen's house is 1171.3600000000001 square feet.*
* You may get 1171.36 instead. Don't worry about this difference - it turns out that this is a common problem when working with double values. It's called a precision (or round-off) error and has to do with how floating-point numbers are stored in the computer's memory. You do not need to know most of the details, but we will talk about when and how to use doubles to avoid having precision errors impact our code.
How to Submit:
Go to Canvas and submit your file to assignment PA02.
Double check that your file is named named exactly PA02.java
Complete the PA02 Reflection on Canvas. 
Your work on this assignment will not be counted as complete until you do.
Grading Criteria:
test1: checks program output.
Teacher check: reflection questions complete and thoughtful, and the code reflects debugging the original code rather than writing completely new code.
